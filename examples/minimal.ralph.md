# .ralph.md - Minimal Configuration

The simplest possible guidance. Uses all defaults except where noted.

## State Files

Use default plan format. Plans in `plans/` directory.

## Work Units

Default: `## ` headings as sections.

## Review

Skip magi - self-review only. Run tests after each section.

## Completion

Default: archive to `plans/archived/` when complete.
